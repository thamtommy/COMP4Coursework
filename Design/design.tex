\section{Overall System Design}

\subsection{Short description of the main parts of the system}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Restaurant Simulator
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Core Elements of System
		\item General User Interface
		\item Adding Item
		\item Deleting Item
		\item Saving Order Information
		\item Managing Bookings
		\item Managing Item Menu

	\end{itemize}
		
\end{itemize}

Core Elements of System
\\
The system will be designed to make it easier to track information about the restaurant for the restaurant staff, information will be displayed on the application. Information tracked down includes order information such as what has been ordered by each table and the information about that table like the number of people, date  and time arrived. In addition, booking times will be displayed at the main screen. As well as displaying key information, the system will have features to add/delete/edit information. For example, adding items to an order, deleting irrelevent bookings and editing booking times. The core elements of the system will be based on managing orders and bookings.

General User Interface
\begin{itemize}
	\item Only staff will be able to access this application, so a box will be the first thing that prompts up when the applicaiton is opened. This box will require staff members to enter a password which they have created.
	\item After entering the correct password, the application will display the layout of restaurant in a birds eye view way. The layout will contain shapes which represent each table, each shape will have the number of table on it.
	\item Clicking on table will bring up a box with a layout like an invoice such as the one on page 15.This screen will contain the table's status such as what they ordered, date,time, table number, number of people and total price. The main box in the middle will be split in half where the left half will contain the dishes ordered and the right will contain the drinks ordered. At the bottom will be contain the editing features where there will be an Add, Delete and Finish buttons. In addition, there will be a back arrow at the top and once  this is clicked, it will return to the main interface with the restaurant layout and save the order information.

\end{itemize}

Adding Item
\begin{itemize}
	\item The managing order box that pops up when clicked on a table, will have an 'Add' button at the bottom. This button will have the feature to add a menu item to the order.
	\item When the 'Add' button is clicked, a box will pop up where the user enters the name or item ID and if name or ID is entered correctly, the item will appear on the table status. The menu will be displayed to aid the user.
\end{itemize}

Deleting Item
\begin{itemize}
	\item The managing order box will have a 'Delete' button located at the bottom. This button will have the feature to delete a menu item off the order
	\item When the 'Delete' button is clicked, red boxes with an X will appear next to each item ordered. If the red button is clicked, the item will disappear off the order.
\end{itemize}

Saving Order Information
\begin{itemize}
	\item A 'Finish' button will be located along with the 'Add' and 'Delete' buttons. 
	\item The 'Finish' button will be used once a table has finished eating/ordering. It will save all of the current information about this particular order. 
	\item Information will be the ordered menu items, table number, date, time, number of people and the total price.
\end{itemize}

Managing Bookings
\begin{itemize}
	\item Any table bookings will be displayed on the main screen 
	\item A button labelled "Bookings" will be at the main screen. A box will appear that will be used to manage bookings.
	\item Adding and deleting bookings will be available through this box that is used to manage bookings.
\end{itemize}

Managing Item Menu
\begin{itemize}
	\item There will be an option to add an item to the menu or delete an item off the menu. This will be accessed at the menu bar.
	\item The menu bar will have a drop down box containing "Add Item" "Delete Item"
	\item Adding an item requres the user to input the information required.
	\item Deleting an item will be done by the user entering either the name of the item or the ID. The menu will be displayed to aid the user.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware Specification}

Keyboard and mouse are essential as the keyboard will be used to input information and the mouse will be used to navigate. The program would need to fit a 19" screen, this is important because one of my client's main requirements is to be able to track information and so having a large window fitting the screen will make it easier to look at. A processer with 1GHz will be perfectly suitable for this program to run smoothly and since the user has AMD FX(fm) - 6300 six-core CPU 3.50GHz, the program shouldnt run without any problems. In addition, not much RAM would be needed to run this program, 1GB would be more than enough and since the user has 8GB RAM the program shouldn't experience any further hardware based problems.

\section{Prototyping}

There are many parts of the system that I would like to prototype due to my limited knowledge of them or its complexity.  

I will try to prototye:

\begin{itemize}

	\item The graphical user interface as this would probably one of the most difficult parts of the system I have to create due to not having a lot of experience in the area.
	\item Linking tables to the correct current customer order through GUI. By linking, I want it to display all the correct information such as what they ordered.
	\item The order screen where I would have to function the ability to add items to an order using the database as the source for the items. In addition, displaying the items in a simple 	and clear layout such as the one on page \pageref{fig:Add}. Also, functioning both Delete and Finish would be parts of the program that I am going to prototype.
	\item The linking to the database and have the ability to manipulate different records through the GUI. I am not sure how to display tables from the database either and so I will   			attempt this. I want to display tables because it would help the user to track information such as displaying bookings where the booking date matches the system date.

\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:range_examples}
\end{center}

\subsection{Identification of appropriate storage media}

A hard drive would be preferable to store information due to the large capacity size for the database and the speed to transfer data. The only data that will be stored will be stored in the database which will hold old data for 2 years as data older than 2 years will be deleted. The application itself shouldn't be more than 20mb and the database shouldn't take the majority of a hard drive as a lot of hard drives will be more than 100gb, the database shouldn't be 1gb.  In addition, a USB flash drive would be a much preferred option to back-up data. A USB flash drive is portable and the capacity size is large enough to store the data from the database. Also, they are immune to mechanical shock, magnetic fields, scratches and dust which makes them suitable for backing-up data - data will not corrupt easily. Almost all computers supports USB in this current time and may still be for many more years as USBs keep getting developed and improved.

\subsection{SQL Queries} 
The following SQL Queries will be formated using Python.

\begin{sql}
   create table  Menu(
	MenuID integer,  
	MenuItem text,  
	ItemPrice real,  
	ItemTypeID integer, 
	primary key(MenuID)  
	foreign key(ItemTypeID) references ItemType(ItemTypeID))
\end{sql}
This creates a table called Menu with the attributes \textit{MenuItem}, \textit{ItemPrice}. The primary key is \textit{MenuID} and the foreign key is \textit{ItemTypeID} \\ \\

\begin{sql}
insert into OrderItem
where OrderID = ?, MenuID = ? and Quantity = ?

\end{sql}
This inserts a new OrderItem record with the attributes \textit{OrderID}, \textit{MenuID} and \textit{Quantity} \\ 

\begin{sql}
select *
from Booking
where BookingDate = TodaysDate
\end{sql}
This will return all of the records from the \textit{Booking} table that has the booking date matched with the present system date. The parameter TodaysDate holds the system date at that current time. \\ \\

\begin{sql}
delete from Booking
where BookingID = ?
\end{sql}
This will delete a booking from the \textit{Booking} table with the ID of \textit{BookingID} \\ \\

\begin{sql}
select *
from OrderedItems
where OrderID = ? 
\end{sql}
This will return all ordered items from an order.


\begin{sql}
update ItemPrice
from Menu
where MenuItem = ?
\end{sql}
This will update the price of an item from the menu with the item name of what the user chooses.

\section{Security and Integrity of the System and Data}

\subsection{Security and Integrity of Data}
To ensure that certain data is accurate such as prices of items, I will implememnt referential integrity to various tables in my database. Adding referential integrity would mean, if i perform a certain action to a record in a table which is also used in different table, the records in both tables will be both affected by this action. So if I updated a price of an item from the Menu table, this would also update the price of the item in a previous order.

This program will store personal information about customers such as the customer's name and telehphone number and so according to the data protection act, the information must not be kept longer than necessary. Information that is 2 years old will be deleted automatically, this will be done through the start up of the application. T he application will compare the records of the customers booking dates and the system dates, if there is a difference of 2 years, then the application will delete the records off the database. The information entered must also be accurate and so there will be many validations to make sure information is as accurate as possible.

\subsection{System Security}

I will implement a simple yet effective security feature where a password would need to be inputted by the user to access the program. The user would have to enter the correct password when accessing any data on the system, this will prevent unauthoried access to data. Unauthorised access is also supported by the Computer Misuse Act 1990 which covers: \\

\begin{itemize}
	\item unauthorised access to computer material
	\item unauthorised access to computer material with criminal intent
	\item unauthorised modification of computer material
\end{itemize}

\section{Validation}
