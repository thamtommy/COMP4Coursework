	\item Objective has not been met
	\item I have used radio buttons instead to represent each table
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Main screen - highlighting the tables} \label{fig:radioButton}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Table shapes will be big so it won't be hard to click on them but not so big that 16 tables can fit on the GUI}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Objective has not been met
	\item I have used radio buttons to represent tables therefore I do not have any table shapes to meet this objective

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Clicking on table will bring up a window which shows the status such as the date and food items ordered with noticeable order modification options}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Objective has mostly been met
	\item The user would have to select the table radio button and then click on select
	\item The table has to be occupied to bring up the status window
