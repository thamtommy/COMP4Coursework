\chapter{User Manual}

\section{Introduction}
The purpose of the system is to manage the restaurant in terms of orders and bookings more easily. The application enables the user to add, delete or update a booking and it enables the user to add or delete to an order and have the option to print or preview the invoice for the order. In addition, the user can manage the item menu by adding, deleting or updating an item from the menu. \\

The intended audience for the system was for my client's restaurant. As the system enables the user to manage bookings, the menu and orders, the system could be altered so that it can be used for other restaurants as restaurants usually run the same way.

\section{Installation}

\subsection{Software}
Since the application has been compiled into a windows executable (.exe), the user will not need to make any changes to their computer system or any additional software to run the application.

\subsection{Hardware}

The following hardware will be required to run the system:

\begin{itemize}

	\item A keyboard for user input
	\item A mouse to navigate around the application
	\item A Hard Disk Drive for file storage 
	\item A Visual Display Unit for output
	\item A printer will be needed if the user wants to be able to print invoices
	

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operating System}
I created and tested the application on my Windows 8.1 64Bit computer and so the compiled executable I created should work on my client's computer as it also runs on Windows 8.1 6Bit (see page 27). I have not tested the application on a 32Bit computer therefore, I do not know if it will run without any problems. I can make a 32 Bit version of the application if needed.

\subsection{System Installation}
\begin{landscape}
The new system has been packaged into a windows installer and so to install the new system, follow these steps: \\
1. The install package is called "RestauranSetup", locate to the directory of the install package of where it has been placed.
