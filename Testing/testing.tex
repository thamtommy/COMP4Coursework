         1 & Test the flow of control between the user interfaces & Top-down testing & Without a correct flow of control between the user interfaces, the application will not be useable therefore I must test the flow of control.  \\ \hline
	2 & Test validation of data input is detected & Bottom-up testing & The program needs to be tested on its reliablity and so using this strategy, I will be able to find out \\ \hline
	3 & Test information input is stored in the correct place & Black box testing & Information needs to be stored in the correct place to prevent confusion thus making the application more usable \\ \hline
	4 & Test algorithms to make sure that the output is correct & White box testing & Output needs to be correct for the application to be useable therefore I can find out by using this strategy \\ \hline
	5 & Test that the system fufils the specification & Acceptance testing & Get an overall idea if the new system is usable and meets the requirements of my client  \\ \hline

\subsection{Original Detailed Plan}
The original details plan below looks different than the one in the Design section as I have formatted the plan below so that each test data has its own row.

I have not tested the rows that are in grey due to changes in my program.

\end{center}
	I have removed some tests under 2.09, 2.11 and 2.12 due to changes in my program which made it impossible to have the wrong input in terms of erroneous and boundary inputs. For example, test 2.09 was to verify the table number inputted was valid, I have made my program so now the user can only select tables which exist through a combo box. As for tests 2.11 and 2.12, the user is forced into using the correct times/dates format. I set the minimum date for QDateEdit to be the system date which would mean the user will not be able to input boundary data (make a booking for yesterday).

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Approach to Testing}

I made sure I tested my program thoroughly by going through different types of testing strategies. Going through different testing strategies made me cover most, if not all areas of my program such as testing the flow of control, validation, algorithms and the outputs.  I chose this approach to ensure my whether my program was usable or not. My first strategy (series 1) was top-down testing which enabled me to test the effectiveness of the navigation in the application. Series 2.

\subsection{Problems Encountered}

I encountered a problem on test 4.03 (\ref{fig:Test10} on page \pageref{fig:Test10}) . The total price did not refresh after adding an item, it would only refresh after closing the manage order box and selecting the table again. I also experienced a problem on test 4.09 (\ref{fig:Test9} on page \pageref{fig:Test9}) where all the details of the booking correctly stored in the database apart from the telephone number. The telephone number stored the telephone number input however, if 0 was the first number, the 0 would not be stored but the rest of the numbers would.

\subsection{Strengths of Testing}

The strengths of the approach I took were that I was able to find out whether my program was usable or not. Users of my system will undoubtly make mistakes when inputting information and so I have tested different test data to ensure the system was still usable. In addition, checking the flow of control proved the navigation of the system to be effective.

\subsection{Weaknesses of Testing}

When I tested the sql statements, I relied on the tables displayed on my application to tell me whether the sql statements worked without problems. For example, I deleted a booking on test 6.03 (\ref{fig:searchDeletedBooking} on page \pageref{fig:searchDeletedBooking}) and checked to see if there was an order attached to the booking. The order did not display after searching for the booking but it may have still been in the database - which is what I didn't check. Also, the applcation has 16 radio buttons that represent the tables in the restaurant - I did not test all of them which would of meant that there could have been a fault with the application within the radio buttons that I did not test. Moreover, I did not test on what would happen if I added relatively the same record twice. For example, adding an item to the menu called 'Pork' with a price of 5.3 and then adding 'Pork' again with a price of 4.3 . This would cause confusion after adding lots of records to the database. 

\subsection{Reliability of Application}

I believe that the application is reliable. I have tested the input validation which worked as the system did not proceed if there was an invalid input which would mean there couldn't be any faulty data in the database. Examples of validation can be found on tests 2.08(\ref{fig:Test12} on page \pageref{fig:Test12}) , 2.08.02 (\ref{fig:Test13} on page \pageref{fig:Test13}) and 2.13.01 (\ref{fig:Test11} on page \pageref{fig:Test11}) . However, it would be up to the User to input the correct data such as correctly spelling an item when adding an item to the menu or inputting the right ID when deleting a record.


\subsection{Robustness of Application}
After testing my system without closing it, I believe that application is robust as I did not experience any crashes or any problems that made me not be able use the application normally. Testing the validation did not affect the application in anyway, same goes for the execution of the sql queries.
